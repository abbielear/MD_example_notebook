# Example MD Notebook

This is an example of using a notebook connected to a remote machine, in my case Bristol's BluePebble cluster, to run MD simulations.
Example_notebook.ipynb contains the simplest examples, Example_notebookwithstring.ipynb has lots of the same code, with some extra cells to add things like restraints andrunnign the string method. This is more specific to my system, and I haven't added detailed comments, but feel free to have a look if you're interested.
